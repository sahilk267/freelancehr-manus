- [x] Update Control Plane sender identity cards and reply-to defaults to use the six configured `.fl@overseasjob.in` addresses.

## Acceptance Evidence Follow-up

- [x] Perform a documented workspace-by-workspace QA checklist covering procedure wiring, loading, empty, error, and approval-gate states for Command Center, Prospects, Jobs, Candidates, Interviews, Placements, Finance, Exceptions, Team, and Control Plane.
- [x] Create or expand focused validations for each consequential action covering owner-only authorization, consent/suppression enforcement, audit-event creation, and safe failure.
